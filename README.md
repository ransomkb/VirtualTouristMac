# Virtual Tourist
Virtual Tourist is an iPhone app created as a course project for Udacity. It allows the user to specify a location on a map by dropping a pin, then seeing a virtual album of photos made up of random selections of public photos from that location stored on Flickr. It is a Udacity iOS Developer Nano-degree course project that was coded by Ransom Barber to the Udacity Specifications: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1j-UIi1jJGuNWKoEjEk09wwYf4ebefnwcVrUYbiHh1MI/pub?embedded=true.
